--indigo-300: rgb(165 180 252);
--violet-200: rgb(221 214 254);
```

### Gradient Configuration
```css
/* Dark Base Gradient */
--dark-gradient: repeating-linear-gradient(
  100deg,
  var(--black) 0%,
  var(--black) 7%,
  var(--transparent) 10%,
  var(--transparent) 12%,
  var(--black) 16%
);

/* Aurora Effect Gradient */

@keyframes aurora {
  from {
    background-position: 50% 50%, 50% 50%;
  }
  to {
    background-position: 350% 50%, 350% 50%;
  }
}
```

### Visual Effects
```css
/* Blur and Opacity */
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
opacity: 0.5;
mix-blend-mode: difference;

mask-image: radial-gradient(
  ellipse at 100% 0%,
  black 10%,
  var(--transparent) 70%
);
```

### Performance Optimizations
```css

transform: translateZ(0);
```

### Implementation Notes
- The effect uses multiple layered gradients for depth
- Animation is optimized for performance with GPU acceleration
- Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes
- Reduced motion preferences are respected
- Mobile-optimized with adjusted opacity and blur

### Usage
The aurora background is implemented in the `AuroraBackground` component and can be used as follows:

function YourComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AuroraBackground />
      {/* Your content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Customization
To modify the aurora effect:
1. Adjust color variables in `index.css`
