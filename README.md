## Aurora Background Effect

The aurora background effect is a key visual element of the website, creating a dynamic and engaging atmosphere. Here are the current settings and implementation details:

### CSS Variables
```css
/* Aurora Colors */
--black: rgb(0 0 0);
--transparent: transparent;
--blue-300: rgb(147 197 253);
--blue-400: rgb(96 165 250);
--blue-500: rgb(59 130 246);
--indigo-300: rgb(165 180 252);
--violet-200: rgb(221 214 254);
```

### Gradient Configuration
```css
/* Dark Base Gradient */
--dark-gradient: repeating-linear-gradient(
  100deg,
  var(--black) 0%,
  var(--black) 7%,
  var(--transparent) 10%,
  var(--transparent) 12%,
  var(--black) 16%
);

/* Aurora Effect Gradient */
--aurora-gradient: repeating-linear-gradient(
  100deg,
  var(--blue-500) 10%,
  var(--indigo-300) 15%,

    background-position: 50% 50%, 50% 50%;
  }
  to {
    background-position: 350% 50%, 350% 50%;
  }
}
```

### Visual Effects
```css
/* Blur and Opacity */
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
opacity: 0.5;
mix-blend-mode: difference;

mask-image: radial-gradient(
  ellipse at 100% 0%,
  black 10%,
  var(--transparent) 70%
);
```

### Performance Optimizations
```css

function YourComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AuroraBackground />
      {/* Your content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
