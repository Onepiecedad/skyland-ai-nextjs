            1. Why Skyland AI Was Built – The Future of Work Starts Here
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">
            AI isn't just the future—it's the great equalizer. Discover the vision behind Skyland AI and how it helps businesses of any size do more with less.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            AI isn't just for tech giants. It's a revolution for the rest of us.
            Skyland was born from a simple belief: small teams shouldn't be held back by manual work, burnout, or limited resources.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            We saw how time and energy were being wasted—and how automation could change everything.
            So we built a smarter path forward—where AI doesn't just save time, it gives you freedom.
          </p>
          <p>Freedom to grow. To compete. To build something bigger than your bandwidth. And this is only the beginning.</p>

            2. Your Team Isn't the Problem—Your Systems Are
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-2">It's not about working harder. It's about removing what's slowing you down.</p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Most teams aren't falling short—they're buried in broken systems. Manual tasks. Constant interruptions. Endless admin.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            It's the silent chaos you've learned to live with. And it's draining time, money, and energy every single day.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            Skyland AI replaces that chaos with flow: Automated workflows. Clean handoffs. No friction.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Your team gets to focus. Your business gets to move. No burnout. No bottlenecks. Just growth without drag.

          <p className="mb-2">Get your time, team, and sanity back—without adding complexity.</p>
          <p className="mb-2">
            No more firefighting. No more missed messages. No more lost opportunities.

            4. There Was Before AI—And Then the World Changed
          </h3>

          <p className="mb-2">
            The gap is growing between those who embrace it and those who resist it.
            AI isn't just about saving time. It's about staying relevant.
